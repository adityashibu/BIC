## Concept
---
The **Multilayer Perceptron** was introduced to address the shortcomings of using only a single perceptron. The limitations that a perceptron had was addressed by introducing multiple layers of perceptrons. It's also called a **shallow neural network** 

**Dimensionality of a layer** is the number of units in a layer
